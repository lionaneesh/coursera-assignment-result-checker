Coursera programming assignment result checker
----------------------------------------------

A tampermonkey script that pings you when your programming assignment has been evaluated by coursera servers, so as to eliminate the need of reloading and checking the page manually.

How to use this script?
-----------------------

- Install tampermonkey for Google Chrome (browser extension).
- Add script.js as a new script in tampermonkey.
- Go to the assignment results page of your course. Should be something like: https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-003/assignment/part_results?part_id=4
- Let it rip! :)
